## To Provision...

You'll probably want to fork this repo, and replace `fancycorp` (my org) with your org name.

Beyond that, it should mostly just work.
(And please raise an issue if it does not!)

There are a few other dependencies:
* TODO: GitHub Auth
* Maybe something else?

In `0-bootstrap`, run `terraform apply`

## Example 1: Run Triggers

## Example 2: Workspace Manager

(Mention Destroy-only exists in the bootstrap workspace)

## Example 3: Chain

## Example 4: Mesh
